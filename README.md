# Introduction
This project aims to perform Cat Prey Detection with Deep Learning on any cat in any environement. For a brief and light intro in what it does, check out the [Raspberry Pi blog post](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/deep-learning-cat-prey-detector/)  about it. This 
project utilises a cascade of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process images and infer about the Prey/No_Prey state of a cat image. The reason why it uses a cascade is simple: CNN's need a huge amount of data to learn their task, the amount is related to the complexity of the problem. For general cat prey detection, a NN would need to first learn what a cat is in general, and find out how their snouts differ with and without prey. This turns out to be quite complex for a machine to learn and we simply don't have enough data of cats with prey (only 150 images to be exact). This is why we use a cascade to break up the complex problem into smaller substages:

- First detect if there is a cat or not. There exists a lot of data on this problem and a lot of complete solutions such for example any COCO trained Object detector such as for example [Tensorflows COCO trained MobileNetV2](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/deeplab/g3doc/model_zoo.md). We call it the CatFinder stage which utilises the mentioned Tensorflow object detection API and runs the Tensorflow pretrained MobileNetV2 and soley aims to detect a cat in the image.

- Second we detect the snout of the cat within the image section of the first stage. This is done combination of different Computer Vision (CV) techniques such as HAAR-Cascade and a self trained CNN (CNN-BB + FF).

- Lastly we classify the snout-cropped image of the cat with a self trained CNN based on the VGG16 architecture. It was only trained with ~150 Prey-Snout-Images gathered from the internet and personal images. This is the data-critical section; we can find more than enough images of cats but only very few images of cats with prey in their snout. Obviously the tasks complexity of identifying prey in a cropped image of the snout is simpler than classifying so on a full image, hence the extra steps of the cascade.

Here is a brief overview of the cascade:
